            `Stacey Musa Bala is an intern and active volunteer with Maina & Kids Children Foundation, turning that passion into real-world impact.
`,
            `Born and raised in Northern Nigeria, Stacey has always been aware of the barriers girls face poverty, harmful traditional practices, early marriage, and lack of access to education. But instead of being discouraged, she chose to rise and speak up not only for herself but for countless girls who had no voice.
`,
            `Her journey with Maina & Kids began through our Girl Child Initiative, where her advocacy caught the attention of our team. She was bold, articulate, and driven a natural leader. She believed in community-led change and was eager to be part of something bigger.
`,

            `“I wanted to move from just talking to actually doing,” Stacey says. “That’s why joining Maina & Kids felt right it gave me the space to learn, serve, and make change happen.”
At Maina & Kids Children Foundation, we are proud to walk alongside change makers like Stacey. Her story is proof that when we invest in girls, we raise leaders.

            `At just 13 years old, Amina Sagir Rabiu is already becoming a voice for safe internet practices in her community. As one of the bright minds selected for the SafeNet Ambassadors Program an initiative by Maina & Kids Children Foundation Amina is not just learning about digital safety, she’s actively teaching it.
`,
            `Amina stands out among her peers in Dutse, Jigawa State, not just because of her intelligence and kindness, but because of her deep concern for how the internet is shaping the lives of young people. After attending our SafeNet Ambassadors Workshop during the 2024 Children’s Day celebration, Amina was deeply moved by what she learned about online risks such as cyberbullying, misinformation, and online predators.
 `,
            `“I used to think the internet was just for fun, but now I know it’s also a place that must be used wisely,” Amina says. “I tell my friends that being safe online is just as important as being safe on the streets.”
Amina's leadership is exactly what the SafeNet Ambassadors Initiative aims to cultivate a generation of informed, responsible, and proactive young internet users who can influence their peers positively.

        story: [
            `For decades, the word “Almajiri” has carried a heavy weight in Northern Nigeria often associated with poverty, begging, and a lack of opportunity. But what if that narrative could be rewritten? What if, instead of seeing Almajiri boys on the streets, we saw them building websites, developing mobile apps, and solving real-world problems through technology?`,
            `This is the vision behind Almajiri-in-Tech a bold initiative designed to give vulnerable boys in traditional Islamic schooling systems the tools of the future: digital literacy, coding skills, and entrepreneurial thinking.
`,
            `The streets of Jigawa, Kano, Sokoto, Katsina, and Bauchi are home to millions of Almajiri boys, many of whom have never had access to a computer or the internet. But beneath the dirt-stained clothes and barefoot steps lie brilliant minds waiting to be nurtured.
`,
            `Through Almajiri-in-Tech, these boys are introduced to basic ICT training, from how to use a computer and access educational resources online, to more advanced skills like graphic design, web development, and robotics. The program also teaches them about online safety, ethics, and how technology can be a force for good.
`,
            `“When we gave our first group of 50 Almajiri boys a chance to sit at a computer, their eyes lit up,” says Gambo Maina Bawa, Founder of Maina & Kids Children Foundation. “One of them asked if the screen could show him how to fix a phone. Another said, ‘Can I also build what’s inside this?’ That’s when we knew the hunger to learn is there. They just need the chance.”
`,
            `Beyond the tech skills, Almajiri-in-Tech is about restoring dignity. It’s about giving boys who have been pushed aside by society a voice, a skillset, and a new identity—not as beggars, but as builders of a better tomorrow.`,
            `We believe that technology is a great equalizer. With a laptop and an internet connection, a boy in a dusty northern village can solve problems for the world.
`,
            `Imagine an Almajiri boy who used to beg for N20 now building an app that helps farmers track weather patterns. Imagine a group of former street children becoming Northern Nigeria’s next generation of tech innovators. That is the dream of Almajiri-in-Tech.
`,
            `At Maina & Kids Children Foundation, we’re committed to making that dream a reality one boy, one class, one code at a time.
