By reaching out to over 50 hardworking mothers with health education, gift items, gloves, and face masks, we not only appreciated their dedication to maintaining clean hostels but also contributed to the well-being of their families. Healthier mothers ensure healthier homes, fostering better care for their children, which aligns with our mission to uplift children and their communities.",
