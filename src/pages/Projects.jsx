                        The Almajiri-in-Tech Initiative is a program aimed at
                        empowering marginalized Almajiri boys with basic digital
                        literacy skills. In 2019, we successfully trained 50
                        boys, equipping them with foundational computer
                        knowledge. Following their training, the participants
                        were enrolled to work in nearby cybercaf√©s, providing
                        them with practical experience and a pathway to economic
                        empowerment. This initiative bridges the digital divide
                        and fosters inclusion by integrating underserved youth
                        into the tech ecosystem.
